1. File Structure

Create a main folder for your project (e.g., "home-work-2").
Inside, create the following:
index.html (your homepage)
An images folder to store your images.
A pages folder to hold the HTML files for other pages:
about.html
articles.html
contacts.html
gallery.html
(And any others you want)

home-work-2/ (Main project folder)
├── index.html (Homepage)
├── images/ (Folder for images)
│ └── ... (Place your image files here)
└── pages/ (Folder for other pages)
├── about.html (About page)
├── articles.html (Articles page)
├── contacts.html (Contact page)
└── gallery.html (Gallery page)

2. Navigation Menu

Use the <nav> element to define your website's navigation.
Inside <nav>, use an unordered list (<ul>) with list items (<li>).
Each list item should contain a link (<a>) to a page on your site (e.g., <a href="pages/about.html">About</a>).
Make sure this navigation menu is identical on every page. You can copy and paste the code, or explore ways to include the same menu on multiple pages (like using server-side includes or a templating language, if you've learned those).

3. Page Content

Fill each page with relevant content based on its name:
about.html: Information about yourself, the website, or the project.
articles.html: A collection of articles or blog posts.
contacts.html: A contact form or contact information.
gallery.html: A gallery of images.

4. Contact Form

On contacts.html, create a form using the <form> element.
Include a variety of form elements:
Text inputs (<input type="text">)
Password inputs (<input type="password">)
Radio buttons (<input type="radio">)
Checkboxes (<input type="checkbox">)
Text areas (<textarea>)
Select dropdowns (<select>)
Submit button (<input type="submit"> or <button>)
Group related form elements using <fieldset> and provide labels (<label>) for each element.

5. Image Gallery

On gallery.html, display at least six images.
Use the <img> tag to embed images, and the <figure> and <figcaption> elements to add captions.
Set the target="\_blank" attribute in the <a> tag around each image to open it in a new tab when clicked (e.g., <a href="images/image1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="images/image1.jpg" alt="Image 1"></a>).

6. Anchors Page

Create a new HTML file (e.g., anchors.html).
Add content with multiple sections.
Use anchor links (e.g., <a href="#section2">Go to Section 2</a>) to allow users to jump to specific sections within the page.
Create corresponding anchors (e.g., <a name="section2"></a>) in the relevant sections.

7. Validation

Use the W3C Markup Validation Service (validator.w3.org) to check all your HTML files for errors.
Correct any errors or warnings until your code validates successfully.
